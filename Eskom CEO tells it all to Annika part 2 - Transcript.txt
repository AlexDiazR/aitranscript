Transcription of video Eskom CEO tells it all to Annika part 2

 It's deeply entrenched and it is highly organized.
 Now, also understand that there are many hangers on.
 So if there is a contractor who gets paid a pittance to do cleaning or whatever the case may be,
 to pay someone like that 5,000 round to walk past a gearbox with a screwdriver
 and just with a sharp jab knock out the sight glass where you can check the oil level.
 The gearbox oil then drains and the gearbox fails and somebody who's got a maintenance contract is then called out.
 But the individual who committed the act of sabotage because that's what it is is not the kingpin.
 That's just one of the runners.
 And that is where I think we have a systemic problem.
 It's really so simple.
 And you can't post a policeman over every employee shoulder to watch what they're doing.
 At a certain point in time you have to trust them.
